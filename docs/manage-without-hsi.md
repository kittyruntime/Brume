# Manage without HSI

HSI is a control panel over standard Linux tools, not a replacement for them. For
every area below, the underlying files and commands are the same ones you'd use if
HSI weren't installed — so a stopped `hsi` service, a broken update, or a full
uninstall never leaves the server itself unmanageable.

This page intentionally doesn't cover the file manager or the App Store: browsing
files is just the filesystem (`ls`, `cp`, standard permissions), and every app the
App Store installs is a normal container, covered under Docker below.

## Docker

Containers created through the App Store or the Containers app are ordinary Docker
containers under their configured name — nothing about them depends on HSI staying
up.

```bash
docker ps -a                  # list containers, including stopped ones
docker logs -f <name>
docker start|stop|restart <name>
docker inspect <name>         # ports, mounts, env, labels — everything HSI showed you
```

## Samba (SMB shares)

HSI owns its own config file, `/etc/nasui/samba/smb.conf`, and points `smbd` at it
through a systemd drop-in (`/etc/systemd/system/smbd.service.d/nasui.conf`). The
Samba package's own `/etc/samba/smb.conf` is never touched, so `apt upgrade` never
conflicts with it.

```bash
testparm -s /etc/nasui/samba/smb.conf   # validate the config HSI generated
smbstatus                               # who's connected, to which share
systemctl restart smbd                  # apply a config change by hand
```

Samba's user database is managed the normal way (`smbpasswd`) — HSI keeps it in
sync when you change a password through the UI, but doesn't replace it with its own
store.

## RAID (mdadm)

Arrays HSI creates are plain `mdadm` arrays. Their assembly config is written to
the standard location so they still auto-assemble on boot without HSI running.

```bash
cat /proc/mdstat                  # live array state
mdadm --detail /dev/md0           # full detail on one array
cat /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf         # the assembly config HSI (re)writes on changes
```

## Mounts

Mounts HSI persists go through `/etc/fstab`, the same file `mount -a` and every
distro tool already reads.

```bash
findmnt                    # current mounts
cat /etc/fstab              # persisted entries
mount -a                    # (re)apply fstab by hand
```

## systemd services

HSI itself is three ordinary systemd units — see [Services](../README.md#services)
in the README for the full list and log commands.

```bash
systemctl status hsi hsi-root-worker hsi-nats
journalctl -u hsi -f
```

## What this doesn't cover yet

Users/groups and LVM are also implemented as standard Linux mechanisms (Linux
accounts, `lvm2`) rather than HSI-private state, but don't have a documented
manual-recovery workflow yet. Scheduled rsync backups are the one exception worth
flagging explicitly: the schedule itself (`apps/backend/src/services/
backup-scheduler.ts`) is HSI-internal, not `cron` — a plan won't run on its own if
`hsi` is stopped. The `rsync` command a plan builds, though, is a normal one you can
always run by hand from the plan's source/destination and options.

If you need a manual-recovery workflow that isn't written here yet, the relevant
root-worker source (`apps/root-worker/`) is the authoritative reference for exactly
what commands HSI runs.
